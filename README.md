**Favorite Songs**


This program is designed to illustrate the author's understanding of Express, Node, Ajax, jQuery, and JS.

Once the server has been initialized, one can visit the hosted web-page and add their favorite song to the populated list. If a field is left blank or if the song has already been added to the list, the individual will recieve an appropriate error message.
